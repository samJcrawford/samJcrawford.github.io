### Thoradin
* Has a cursed sword
  * May have been a bayonet from a gun of the giant warforged
  * Belonged to [Aril](#aril)
  * Probably contains her soul or something
  * Might have been designed to capture the souls of those it kills

## NPCs

### Antor
* Cunt
* Researched healing magic as part of the [Arcanix Institute](#arcanix-institute)
* Became obsessed with using magic to rewind time
  * Wants to rewind Khorvaire to before the war

### Aril
* Subject of [Antor](#antor)'s experimental healing magic using time reversal
  * Might have found some way to slow/pause time in the black pit
  * Or maybe just a way of preserving her soul...
* *"This moment is forever"*

### Diorn
* Dwarf, member of [Church of the Nightmother](#church-of-the-nightmother)
* Thrace goofed by trying to accound a fictitious history with him
* Outranked Thrace during their military service

* Knows Joy, fellow Tiefling

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Locations

### Thrane
* Sucks
* Threw us in prison under trumped up charges of necromancy
  * From the train incident with [House Orien](#house-orien)

#### Aundair
* *"They're keeping an eye on things going south"*

#### Marketplace
* Doesn't actually seem to be a marketplace there anymore
* In fact, not much more than [Church of the Nightmother](#church-of-the-nightmother) here.

#### Tower Vigilant
* Hollowed out body of an ancient giant warforged 

## Factions

### Arcanix Institute
* Sucks
* Based in [Aundair](#aundair)
* Seems to have created some technorexes

### Church of the Nightmother
* Band of weirdos fresh from Rose Cross (no not [those ones](#the-party))

### House Orien
* *"House Orien would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we suck"*
